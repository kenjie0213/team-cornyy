        <h2>Corn Smut</h2>
        <p>It also known as Ustilago maydis. It is a corn disease caused by a fungus that infects the corn plant.
            The fungus forms large, ditored growths called galls or tumors on the kernels which are filled with a 
            mass of dark spores. Galls are considered delicacy. <br><br>
            The fungus that causes corns smut can survive for years in the soil or crop debris, and it can infect
            other corn plants at any stage of growth.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>Solutions</b>
            <br>
            1. To prevent or control the smut, farmers can apply crop rotation which they are going to avoid
            the infected area/s before. <br>
            2. The infected debris must remove and properly decompose. <br>
            3. They can use fungicides or biological control agents to prevent or manage disease.

        <h2>Downy Mildew</h2>
        <p>It is a fungal disease that affects corn plants, cuased by the pathogen peronoscleropora sorghi. 
            It is characterized by yellow to white pacthes on the upper suface of the leaves and a grayish-purple
            growth on the lower surface. <br><br>
            It can spread through wind-disperesed spores, which can survive in the crops debris or soil for several
            years.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>Solutions</b>
            <br>
            1. Crop rotation: Planting corn in a different field each year can help to reduce the buildup of fungal spores
            in the soil. <br>
            2. Resistant varieties: Planting corn varieties that are resitant to downy mildew can help to reduce the impact 
            of the disease. <br>
            3. Fungicides: It can help to control or prevent downy fungi. <br>
            4. Monitoring: Regular monitoring for symptoms of downy mildew can help to detect outbreaks early and allow
            for timely control measures to be implemented

        <h2>Bacterial Stalk Rot</h2>
        <p>It is a corn disease that affects and cuased by the baterium Erwinia chrysanthemi. It is characterized
            by a sofy, watery rot of the stalks, often accompanied by a foul odor. This can lead to lodging of the plants
            and significant yiels losses. <br><br>

            5. Avoiding damage to the plant: Minimizing plant damage from insects or cultivation can help to reduce
            the risk of bacterial stalk rot. <br>
            6. Sanitaion: Removing and destroying infected plant debris can help to reduce the spread of the 
            disease.
